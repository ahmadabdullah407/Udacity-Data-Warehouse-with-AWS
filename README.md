# Data Warehouse Project Sparkify ETL:
## Project Introduction:
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

My role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis.
## Prerequisites:
This project makes the folowing assumptions:
- Python 3 installed,Python 3 Libraries available are given below:
    - pandas.
    - psycopg2.
    - configparser.
    - boto3.
    - json.
- The data resides in S3.
- Jupyter Notebook is available.
- I created my own Amazon Redshift in cluster but user will need to have his own Amazon Redshift cluster available on AWS.
## Dataset:
For this project, we shall be working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

-   Song data:  `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
-   Log data:  `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`

Log data json path:  `s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json
### Song Dataset:

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the  [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

```

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
````
### Log Dataset:

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this  [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim)  based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Schema for Song Play Analysis:

Using the song and log datasets, I created a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis.This star schema has 1  _fact_  table (songplays), and 4  _dimension_  tables (users, songs, artists, time).

## Project Template:
Files used in the project:

-  **sql_queries.py**  contains all sql queries, and is imported into the files bellow.
-  **create_tables.py**  drops and creates tables. Run this file to reset your tables before running ETL scripts each time.
-  **test.ipynb**  displays the first few rows of each table to check database.
-  **etl.py**  loads data from S3 into staging tables on Redshift and then process that data into analytics tables on Redshift.
-  **README.md**  current file, provides discussion on my project.
- **Execution.ipynb**  To execute *create_tables.py* and  *etl.py*.
-  **creating_cluster.ipynb** Creates a new IAM role and Redshift cluster on AWS.However I removed this file because it contained information about my AWS account.
## Steps Followed:
1. I wrote DROP, CREATE, COPY and INSERT query statements in *sql_queries.py*.
2.  I  launched a redshift cluster and create an IAM role that has read access to S3.
3. I  added redshift database and IAM role info to  `dwh.cfg`.
4. I  complete the logic in  `create_tables.py` & `etl.py`  to connect to the database and create these tables.
5. In *Execution.ipynb* I executed the following code block:
```
    %run 'create_tables.py'
    %run 'etl.py'
```
6. I included  `DROP TABLE`  statement for each table, this way I could run drop and create tables whenever i want to reset my database and test my ETL pipeline.
7.  I tested my results by running the proper select statements in *Test.ipynb*.
